Node needs to be installed

```
$ brew install node
```

Install assignment dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
Execute the tests with:
```
$ npm test
```
In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing xtest to test
